# ETL
 A document of configuration design of the tables that are required.

 

1 - Master Table (This table holds the details of the client/file level requirement details)

2 - Detail Table (This table holds the details of the field level requirement details)

3 - Request Table (This table holds details of request)

4 - Main Table (This table holds actual data of the clients)

 

Note – You can use dummy data for the main table. Insert atleast 4 test client data.

 

Q1 – Create 5 files from the Pentaho Framework. (without double quotes)

i)                    First & Second file should be in delimiter format with (, and |) delimiter.

ii)                   Third file should be in FixedLength file format with length and padding according to your wish.

iii)                 Fourth file should be in excel format without header fields.

iv)                 Fifth file should be in excel format with header fields.

 

Q2 – Repeate Q1 with double quotes in each and every file.

 

For both the questions you can assume columns for each client in the output file as per your wish.
